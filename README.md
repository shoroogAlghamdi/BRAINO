# BRAINO

In order to enhance peoples' intuitive speed, concentration ability and mental health,  while taking into consideration that most of people are so busy with the normal life’s activities that they don’t have time to take courses or attend lectures, we decided to develop a very simple interactive game that helps to achieve the goals mentioned above and can be accessible with the least possible cost.

We chose to build a mobile game since most people spend their time on phones to accomplish daily tasks, so this game will be available on hands with the least cost. The game is a 3-level competition that is directed to our main targeted users, which are children from 10-13 years, teenagers and adults. The game solves one of the most faced problems, which is loss of concentration and mental distraction. BRAINO is composed of three levels, where each level corresponds to a specific users' range. The levels vary in the degree of complexity depending on the users to whom the level is designed. As the player proceeds through the one level, the questions/challenges will get more complex, so that we can ensure that the users are gaining skills and getting healthier in terms of mental ability.

# Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes:
- Download the project.
- Download the two folder (KGradientPanel-master &  KControls-master).
- Unzip the project and the two folders.
- Add the two files (KGradientPanel-master &  KControls-master) as JAR files to the BRAINO project.
  - KGradientPanel-master:
    To be able to create a panel with gradient-background.
    
 - KControls-master:
    To be able to create rounded-corner buttons with gradient-background and other advanced coloring options.
    
- Run the project on a NetBeans IDE.

# Prerequisites

These are the tools and framewroks used in this project (MUST have):

- Netbeans IDE (one of the latest versions is preferred).
- The two folders (KGradientPanel-master &  KControls-master).


# How to add the JAR files

After unzipping the two libraries (KGradientPanel-master &  KControls-master), do the following steps to install the KGradientPanel:
1. In the JFrame form, where you want to use the gradient panel, go to the design  tab.
2. In the Swing Containers section, right click and select the Palatte Manager.
3. Click on Add From JAR button.
4. Go to the folder where you unzipped the file.
5. Open KGradientPanel-master folder.
6. Open dist folder.
7. Select the KGradientPanel JAR file and ckick on next.
8. Select the KGradientPanel component and click on Finish.

Same stesp should be applied to get the KControls installed, except that you will have to add them to the Swing Controls sections instead of Swing Containers.
