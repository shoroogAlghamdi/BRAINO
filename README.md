# BRAINO

In order to enhance peoples' intuitive speed, concentration ability and mental health,  while taking into consideration that most of people are so busy with the normal life’s activities that they don’t have time to take courses or attend lectures, we decided to develop a very simple interactive game that helps to achieve the goals mentioned above and can be accessible with the least possible cost.

We chose to build a mobile game since most people spend their time on phones to accomplish daily tasks, so this game will be available on hands with the least cost. The game is a 3-level competition that is directed to our main targeted users, which are children from 10-13 years, teenagers and adults. The game solves one of the most faced problems, which is loss of concentration and mental distraction. BRAINO is composed of three levels, where each level corresponds to a specific users' range. The levels vary in the degree of complexity depending on the users to whom the level is designed. As the player proceeds through the one level, the questions/challenges will get more complex, so that we can ensure that the users are gaining skills and getting healthier in terms of mental ability.

# Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes:
- Download the project.
- Download the two libraries.
- Unzip the project.
- Add the two libraries (KControls-master & KGradientPanel-master) as JAR files to the BRAINO project.
  - KControls-master:
    To be able to create round-corner buttons with gradient-background and other advanced options for coloring.
    
  - KGradientPanel-master:
    To be able to create a panel with gradient-background.
    
- Run the project on a NetBeans IDE.

# Prerequisites
